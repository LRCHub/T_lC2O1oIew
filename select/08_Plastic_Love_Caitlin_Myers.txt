A sudden kiss in the morning, a tender gaze in the evening
Beyond my range of comprehension until you brought to attention
Greetings always followed by sweet goodbyes, yes, all must meet its end
Baby, can’t you just relax? Don't look back, don’t hurry!
Still reminiscing the day when you left me all on my own, then
I walked away from any daylight, instead of dawn it was twilight
Underneath the disco ball breaks the spell that holds you in my mind
Though I used to dance with you, now we’re through, I’m sorry!
Don't you dare even try to convince me, don’t you lie ‘bout the way that we could be
"Love’s a game" they all say it, they mean it–might as well have fun, play every single one
I filled the holes and the cracks in my heart with fancy high heels and plenty of dresses
They’re my sole companions on this journey
Many men, that are fishing and begging, speak of love but they’re still second-guessing
Hollow vows, even promises broken: every face and voice brings memories of you
Glassy eyes shedding tears of my sorrow, hoping they will forget by tomorrow
Praying no one’s asking for the reason.
A thousand dazzling lights surround me, glimmering with mysticality
As if they’re calling me to head back, but tired train rides endure that,
Half-asleep I hear a sigh, hear a voice speak whispers best ignored
Should I even bother though, yes or no: don’t worry!
I'm just playing games, I know that's plastic love
Dance to the plastic beat, another morning comes
I'm just playing games, I know that's plastic love
Dance to the plastic beat, another morning comes
