Let's go out
Wherever you are feeling to
And if you're tired now
Together we'll walk out

Yeah, baby I'm on this everlasting lucid dream
Of plastic love when you're with me

Maybe you know
I'm wearing all your coco screen
Yeah, waiting for you
Just to be free

You know I would die
Really just to be with you
My plastic love here with you

Ooh, baby, don't you love me?
Ooh, baby, don't you love me?
